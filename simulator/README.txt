sim-new.js is the simulator our documentation is based on. However, it doesn't perform as desired.

sim.py is the most up-to-date simulator and it performs as desired. It was built and tested (somewhat) with Python 2.7. It requires the pymongo module, so install pymongo if you don't have it. (see comments in sim.py for instructions on how to install pymongo)
